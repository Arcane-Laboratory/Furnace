# Global Project Rules

## Code Philosophy

- Less code > more code. Reduce, reuse, recycle. More LOC, more problems.
- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary
- Do not add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Reuse existing abstractions where possible and follow the DRY principle

## Package Management

- Use Yarn Workspaces exclusively; do not use npm
- Run workspace commands via `yarn workspace <name> <command>`

## Documentation

- Prefer `docs/` for plans, architecture, and design documents
- Do not proactively create README or markdown files unless explicitly requested

## Code Style

- No emojis anywhere: code, logs, commits, comments
- Follow strict TypeScript configs from `tsconfig.json`
- Follow ESLint configs from `.eslintrc.json`
- Maintain consistent naming, structure, and patterns across services

## Commits

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- No emojis in commit messages
- Use conventional commit format when appropriate
