# Tutorial Design - Level 1

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: [Current Date]  
**Purpose**: Design specification for Level 1 tutorial level

---

## Teaching Philosophy

### Hands-Off Approach
- **No Tooltips/Text**: Teaching done purely through level design
- **Guided by Level Design**: Initial elements and level structure teach mechanics
- **Experimentation**: Players learn by doing, not reading
- **Visual Learning**: Mechanics demonstrated through initial element placement

---

## Core Mechanics to Teach

### Primary Lesson: Fireball vs Enemies vs Furnace
**First mechanic to teach:**
- Fireball kills enemies
- Enemies kill the furnace (one touch = game over)
- This is the core threat/objective

### Secondary Lesson: Redirect Runes
**Main runes to demonstrate:**
- Redirect Runes and editing them
- Rotating runes to point at each other
- Strategic rune placement and direction

---

## Level Design Specifications

### Difficulty
- **Nearly Guaranteed Win**: Very easy, almost impossible to lose
- **Success Condition**: Players only need to rotate runes properly
- **Purpose**: Build confidence, teach core mechanics without frustration

### Initial Elements
- **Redirect Runes**: Pre-placed redirect runes to demonstrate
- **Strategic Placement**: Runes placed to show how they can point at each other
- **Purpose**: Show examples of rune interactions and editing

### Enemy Setup
- **Few Enemies**: Minimal enemy count (just enough to demonstrate)
- **Basic Enemies Only**: Only Basic Enemy type (no Fast/Tank)
- **Simple Path**: Clear, straightforward path to furnace
- **Purpose**: Focus on mechanics, not challenge

### Resource Allocation
- **Generous Resources**: More than enough to complete level
- **Purpose**: Allow experimentation without resource stress

### Level Structure
- **Simple Layout**: Clear, uncluttered grid
- **Obvious Solution**: Rotating pre-placed redirect runes solves the level
- **Purpose**: Teach through success, not failure

## Teaching Flow

### 1. Observation Phase
- Player sees initial setup:
  - Furnace at top
  - Enemies will spawn
  - Pre-placed redirect runes
  - Fireball will launch automatically

### 2. Experimentation Phase
- Player can:
  - Rotate redirect runes
  - Place additional structures (if desired)
  - Request pathfinding visualization
  - Experiment freely

### 3. Execution Phase
- Player clicks Start button
- Fireball launches automatically
- Fireball travels through redirect runes (if rotated correctly)
- Fireball kills enemies
- Level completes successfully

### 4. Learning Outcomes
- Understand: Fireball kills enemies
- Understand: Enemies kill furnace
- Understand: Redirect runes change fireball direction
- Understand: Can rotate/edit redirect runes
- Understand: Runes can point at each other for strategic paths

## Design Principles

### Clarity Over Complexity
- One clear mechanic at a time
- Visual examples through initial elements
- Obvious cause and effect

### Success Through Understanding
- Nearly impossible to fail
- Success comes from understanding, not skill
- Builds confidence for later levels

### Hands-On Learning
- No text explanations needed
- Learning through doing
- Visual demonstration through level design

---

## Implementation Notes

### Initial Rune Placement
- Place redirect runes in positions that:
  - Show they can redirect fireball
  - Demonstrate pointing at each other
  - Create obvious solution when rotated correctly

### Enemy Placement
- Minimal enemies
- Clear path
- Enough to demonstrate threat but not overwhelming

### Resource Balance
- More than enough resources
- Allow player to experiment
- Don't create resource anxiety

**Status**: Ready for level designer to create Level 1 tutorial
