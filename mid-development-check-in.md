The puprose of this document is to check in with ourselves about our progress and direction.
Is the game fun? Are choices impactful? What about it is fun and how do we double down on it? What is not fun? What is ignored or useless?

## Fun

It is fun to feel the power fantasy of a magical furnace. When your fireball does a good job of killing enemies, it feels good.

However:

### lack of build diversity

- the only valid approach to killing enemies is with the acceleration rune
- the reflect rune is less versitile than the redirect rune, is more expensive, and only works once
- the explosive rune is nice, but it only works one time
- the acceleration rune is very fun and immediately powerful. the cap is hit early

### lack of anticipation

- without knowing more information about incoming enemies, planning is not very fun
    - this can be mitigated via level design, by creating levels which have more initial tiles set
        - for example, a full map and very constrained resources

### Short Level Loop

- because one level is one wave, there is less of a feeling of investing in your build
    - enemies could drop scrap, which could allow you to build and access other parts of the level, but we need to design some levels and get them working first
